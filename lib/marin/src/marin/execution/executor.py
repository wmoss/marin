"""
The `Executor` framework provides a way to specify a DAG of `ExecutorStep`s that
are executed in a topological order using Fray.  Beyond that:

1. The key distinguishing feature of the framework is allowing the user to
   flexibly control what steps are "new".

2. A secondary feature of the framework is that it creates sensible output paths
   for each step to free the user from having to come up with interpretable
   names that don't clash.

As an example, suppose you have a two-step pipeline:

    transform(method) -> tokenize(method)

which can be instantiated as:

    [A] transform(trafilatura) -> tokenize(llama2)
    [B] transform(resiliparse) -> tokenize(llama2)
    [C] transform(trafilatura) -> tokenize(llama3)
    [D] transform(resiliparse) -> tokenize(llama3)

If you have already run a particular instantiation, running it again
should be a no-op (assume idempotence).  If you run [A], then running [C] should
reuse `transform(trafilatura)`.

## Versioning

But the big question is: when is a step `transform(trafilatura)` "new"?
In the extreme, you have to hash the code of `transform` and the precise
configuration passed into it, but this is too strict: Semantics-preserving
changes to the code or config (e.g., adding logging) should not trigger a rerun.

We want to compute a *version* for each step.  Here's what the user supplies:
1. a `name` (that characterizes the code and also is useful for interpretability).
2. which fields of a `config` should be included in the version (things like the
   "method", not default thresholds that don't change).

The version of a step is identified by the name, versioned fields, and the
versions of all the dependencies. This version is represented as a hash (e.g.,
8ce902).

## Output paths

Having established the version, the question is what the output path should be.
One extreme is to let the framework automatically specify all the paths, but
then the paths are opaque and you can't easily find where things are stored.

Solution: based on the name and version, the output path of a step is computed.
For example, if name is "documents/fineweb-resiliparse", then the full path
might be:

    gs://marin-us-central2/documents/fineweb-resiliparse-8c2f3a

## Final remarks

- If you prefer to manage the output paths yourself, you can not use `versioned`
  fields and specify everything you want in the name.  Note the version will
  still depend on upstream dependencies and "pseudo-dependencies."

- The pipeline might get too big and unwieldy, in which case we can cut it up by
  specifying a hard-coded path as the input to a step.  Or perhaps we can have
  our cake and eat it to by putting in an "assert" statement to ensure the input
  path that's computed from upstream dependencies is what we expect.

- If we decide to rename fields, we can extend `versioned` to take a string of
  the old field name to preserve backward compatibility.

- "Pseudo-dependencies" are dependencies that do not block the execution of
  the step, but are still included in the version.  This is useful for depending
   on checkpoints of in-progress training runs, for example. When you run a step
  that has a pseudo-dependency, it will not wait for the pseudo-dependency to
  finish executing (or even check if it is executing or failed) before running.
