    Converts a path pointing to a levanter or huggingface checkpoint into a name we can use as an id for an analysis
    step or similar. For instance, if the path is "checkpoints/{run_name}/checkpoints/step-{train_step_number}",
    we would get "run_name-train_step_number"

    If it's "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B" it should just be "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B"

    This method works with both strings and InputNames.

    If an input name, it expect the InputName's name to be something like "checkpoints/step-{train_step_number}"
